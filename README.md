Button board for the Raspberry PI PiHPSDR control software

There are 6 KY-040 rotary encoders mounted on a board that can be
connected directly to the Raspberry PI 3 board.  The bigger 20x2
connector is used to connect all of the useful GPIOs to the rotary 
encoders on this board - or on an second peripheral board that has 
the remaining buttons and the big 600 ppr encoder used for tuning.
